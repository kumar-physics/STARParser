SANS: Simple API for NMR-STAR
-----------------------------

  Simple API for NMR-STAR (SANS) is modelled after Simple API for XML (SAX). 
  SANS is a simple NMR-STAR parser that parses input line-by-line and either
  
    calls user-defined methods (callbacks) for each element of NMR-STAR 
    syntax it encouters, or
    
    writes those elements to java.io.Writer (so that they can be passed to
    e.g. Starlib parser; see Combined.java in doc/examples subdirectory).

  SansParser in this package also does minimal syntax checking.

  ContentHandler: callbacks for valid tokens.
  
  ErrorHandler: callbacks for syntax errors.

  SansParser is a JavaCC-generated parser.
    Note that SansParser is an NMR-STAR (not generic STAR) parser. NMR-STAR 
    syntax is more restrictive than generic STAR, this parser is not suitable 
    for parsing generic STAR files.
    
 SansException is an object for passing parse errors around (mainly because 
 that's how org.xml.sax.ErrorHandler methods do it). It is also thrown by the 
 parser if you try to use it without registering the handlers first.

  Undocumented classes: JavaCC generates a number of support classes for
  SansParser. These are not documented here; refer to JavaCC documentation.

doc/examples: usage examples

    Simple.java: basic usage example
    
    EntryInfo.java: extracts entry information from NMR-STAR file
    
    Combined.java: uses SANS parser to skip to a particular saveframe,
    then uses starlib parser to parse that saveframe into a SaveFrameNode.
