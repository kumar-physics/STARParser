Therefor the ACE CA is mappedto CA and not C1 as might be more appropriate in IUPAC.-4-For many schemes the nucleic acid part needs to be added still.;   loop_      _Residue_mapping.Lib_residue_name      _Residue_mapping.IUPAC_residue_name             HIS+   HIS          LYS+   LYS          ARG+   ARG          GLU-   GLU          ASP-   AS  op  stop_save_
